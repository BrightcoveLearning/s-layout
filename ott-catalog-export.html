    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>OTT Catalog Export generally assists in getting your OTT assets available on platform searches, for instance Apple and Roku, as well as in search engines. For instance, the functionality provides viewers with the ability to find movies and TV shows that are available on Beacon iOS and tvOS apps using the built-in search utilities on iPhones and Apple TV devices. The discovered titles are then either opened in the OTT app or the viewer is guided through app installation and then opens the app to view the desired content.</p>
    <p>Specifically, the OTT Catalog Export functionality available in Studio is used for the following tasks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create an <strong>Apple UMC Catalog CSV</strong> and <strong>Apple UMC Availability CSV</strong> template(s) that generates a data report that is submitted to Apple to enable universal search.</li>
      <li>Create a <strong>Google site map XML</strong> template that generates a sitemap that is used with Google search.</li>
      <li>Create a <strong>Sitemap index XML</strong> template that generates a data report that is an index for your sitemaps.</li>
      <li>Create a <strong>SEO Page HTML</strong> template that greatly enhances behavior of your OTT app with searches and viewers sharing assets.</li>
      <li>Create a <strong>Roku Search Feed 2.0</strong> template that generates a data report that is submitted to Roku to enable universal search.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The general tasks to create one of these data reports is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Add a new template. Note that for <strong>SEO Page HTML</strong> templates this is all that is required, for other template types proceed to the next step.</li>
      <li>Create a new job that uses the template.</li>
      <li>Run the job, either manually or on a schedule, to produce the desired data report.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Starting in the <a href="/layout/ott-catalog-export.html#Adding_a_new_template">Adding a new template</a> section below are enumerated steps to perform these tasks.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Overview_of_the_processes">Overview of the processes</h2>
    <p>Using OTT Catalog Export tools to implement and improve searching for your video assets is a process. The process involves you, Brightcove's OTT delivery team and sometimes the platform vendor themselves. Following are quick overviews for Apple, Google and Roku.</p>
    <h3>Apple</h3>
    <p>First, you need to work with Brightcove's OTT Delivery Team and Apple to prepare for the universal search implementation. Typically, one <strong>Apple UMC Catalog CSV</strong> template is created for each supported asset type (series, season, episode, movie), and a single <strong>Apple UMC Availability CSV</strong> template is created that aggregates availability info for all asset types. The data in all the reports needs to match the current state of your catalog. You again work with Brightcove's OTT Delivery Team to be sure the CSV reports are in the correct format. Once the format is verified, you submit the data to Apple. Once the process is working, you periodically submit new data to Apple.</p>
    <p>Note that the initial setup and verification process can take up to several months.</p>
    <h3>Google Search</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Google site map XML</strong> and <strong>Sitemap index XML</strong> templates work together to improve search results using sitemaps. You generate one or more sitemaps (possibly more than one because of size) and the sitemap index is the top level file that points to your sitemap(s). After these files are generated you submit the resulting file's URLs to Brightcove's OTT Delivery Team and the OTT app is reconfigured to incorporate them. Once the process is working, no further manual submissions are needed, assuming that a stored job was created to automatically refresh the sitemap(s) periodically. As long as the stored job continues to refresh the sitemap(s), Google automatically crawls those sitemaps periodically as well.</p>
    <h3>SEO Page HTML</h3>
    <p>The <strong>SEO Page HTML</strong> templates work with the <strong>Google site map XML</strong> and <strong>Sitemap index XML</strong> templates to provide enhanced search engine optimization (SEO) as well as other benefits in social media sharing of your assets. When the OTT app backend detects a search crawler trying to load one of the web app pages, it fetches a corresponding SEO-optimized page from the syndication service and return that page content to the crawler instead of the normal, SEO-unfriendly web app page.</p>
    <p>Unlike other template types, <strong>SEO Page HTML</strong> templates are used to generate asset-specific results in response to on-demand requests from the webapp. As a result, there is no need to create or run stored jobs that include template instances of this type.</p>
    <h4>Benefits</h4>
    <p>The benefits of the SEO optimization are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Assets appear individually</strong>: Without the SEO optimization, Google reports a single entry for your OTT web app:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-layout-img/ott-catalog-export/google-search-no-seo.png" alt="google search no seo">
        </figure>
        <p>Whereas after the SEO optimization is done, each asset appears in the search:</p>
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-layout-img/ott-catalog-export/google-search-with-seo.png" alt="google search with seo">
        </figure>
      </li>chruby
      <li><strong>Social media enhancement</strong>: When sharing a link over social media, rather than simply the link being displayed, a nicely formatted block of information is shown which includes the title, description and an image:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-layout-img/ott-catalog-export/social-media-enhancement.png" alt="social media enhancement">
        </figure>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To implement this feature, you need to use the <strong>SEO Page HTML</strong>, <strong>Google site map XML</strong> and <strong>Sitemap index XML</strong> templates to generate the required data and pass these reports to Brightcove's OTT Delivery Team. Brightcove personnel then configure your app to use the SEO functionality. Periodically you need to regenerate the data and post to the location directed by Brightcove.</p>

    <h3>Roku</h3>
    <p>You need first to go to the Roku site and complete forms that enable you to submit syndication data. Once completed, you generate data using the <strong>Roku Search Feed</strong> template. Using that data you work with Brightcove's OTT Delivery Team to submit it to Roku. Once the process is working, no further manual submissions are needed, assuming that a stored job was created to automatically refresh the search feed(s) periodically. As long as the stored job continues to refresh the search feed(s), Roku automatically, periodically pulls the latest feed from the results URL.</p>

    <h2 id="Possible_conflicts">Possible conflicts</h2>
    <p>There are two conflicts possible when running jobs that use multiple templates. Those conflicts are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A Beacon application cannot support a job or jobs that publish to the web that use multiple templates of the same <strong>Platform and format type</strong>. For example, a Beacon app cannot have two <strong>Google site map XML</strong> templates (or two <strong>Sitemap index XML</strong> templates).</li>
      <li>A Beacon application cannot support a job or jobs that use multiple templates that publish to the same filename. For example, a Beacon app cannot have a <strong>Google site map XML</strong> template that publishes to <code>sitemap.xml</code> AND a <strong>Sitemap index XML</strong> template that also publishes to the same name, <code>sitemap.xml</code>. You must use different file names.</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning language-editable">Note that these conflicts can occur across separate jobs.</aside>
