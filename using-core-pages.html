    <p>Core pages provide you with options you wish to provide your viewers. Core pages provide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Functionality for viewers to configure, and view information about, their app instance.</li>
      <li>Basic services like sign in, exit, logout and search.</li>
      <li>Lists of past viewer activities like recently watched, purchases, downloads and videos marked as a favorite.</li>
      <li>Display live tv and EPG (electronic program guide) schedules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A subset of all the core pages are added to every {{ site.product_short }} instance, and others added through onboarding and as needs arise.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">For <strong>all</strong> core pages you can edit the actual name of the page (in all supported languages) and the page's availability. This is reflected in the following table's <em>Confugurable</em> column. For core pages that you can configure <em>beyond</em> those two features, there is a link in the table which will take you to configuration details.</aside>
