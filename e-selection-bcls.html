    <p>Player E is the latest player, and eventually all new customers automatically get Player E.</p>
    <p>Player E is a player for VOD videos, linear channels and live events in which viewers watch media assets. The player incorporates many new features across all platforms. The following two documents discuss and contain videos that demonstrate those features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/layout/e-vod-features.html">Player E VOD Features</a></li>
      <li><a href="/layout/e-live-features.html">Player E Live Features</a></li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">In Beacon <strong>web</strong> apps, all Player E instances are based on Brightcove Player. Beacon automatically uses the <strong>Brightcove Default Player</strong> for Player E functionality. At this time the player version supported in Beacon is <strong>6.66.8</strong> For more information on the instances and what Brightcove Player plugins are used for each instance, see the <a href="/general/references/bcp-plugin-compatibility.html">Brightcove Player Plugin Compatibility with Player E</a> document.
    </aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">When using <strong>Player E</strong>, the viewer is sent back to the previous screen when playback for a movie, a live event, or the last episode of a season ends.</aside>

    <h3>Default Audio Track Selection</h3>
    <p>Default Audio Selection allows you to listen to content in your preferred language based on your location, browser/device settings, etc., without continuously selecting the desired audio track on the player.</p>

    <p><em>General behavior</em>: If you explicitly select a preferred audio track on the Beacon app, that preferred audio track will be used as a reference to auto-select the same audio track language on the following video (if that audio track language is available). This option is saved locally on each device (even on the same user on the same platform on two or more devices; this will be specific on each device).</p>
